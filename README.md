Remind yourself to do your art practice
Put your reference images in a directory (you can have them in subfolders too) and then paste that directory path in here
```
# Set the directory containing the images
image_directory = r"C:\path\to\directory"
```

Change the amount of time you want to keep the reference image on screen as required or the time interval.
